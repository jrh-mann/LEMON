NEVER create markdown files unless instructed

Work atomically, prior to every change define tests and criteria for their acceptance, once these are passed, commit that change.

Make minimal changes to the codebase, work in small, surgical ways, comment your code, to explain what each component does, do not introduce tech debt.

Fail loudly, do not have errors propagate, we are interested in knowing exactly what is going on at all times, if an error occurs it should be realised.

Work within the grand vision of the project, all components should be with reference to that.
